          What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year of
          running trips down the Grand Canyon. This year we ran 36 trips down
          the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to one of our favorite
          places on earth. We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them to our
          family. The season started off with some chilly weather in the early
          season, but our guests braved the cold and loved every minute of their
          trip (show pictures). Later the temperatures soared reaching highs of
          120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon. We didn't have any
          trouble getting people in the water at those temperatures.

          Our trips are all run in some of the most remote areas of the United
          States. We share these areas with lots of critters both large and
          small. Here are some tips on what to do if you should find yourself
          face to face with one. Scorpions: There are hundreds of varieties of
          scorpions, most of them being harmless. There are, however, a handful
          of them that can be dangerous and even potentially lethal. Scorpions
          can be found in almost every ecosystem and are very adaptable to their
          environment. The scorpion that calls Phantom Ranch in the Grand Canyon
          home is the Bark Scorpion, the most venomous in the United States. Do
          not worry though, the bark scorpions are only lethal to their prey and
          luckily humans are not on that list! They spend the day hiding and
          crawl out at night to hunt. They will eat crickets, moths, spiders and
          other insects. Many compare their sting to an intense bee sting.
          Relief can be found with ice, aspirin and time. When in the canyon,
          pay attention to where you are walking at night. Always wear your
          shoes or sandals. Always have a light with you to see where you are
          going. Never try to capture a scorpion and if you get stung, see your
          guide immediately. Big horn sheep: For many people, bighorn sheep
          symbolize the rugged mountain west. It is one of two species of wild
          sheep in North America. It’s compact body is muscular with chocolate
          brown fur. Most weigh 160-250 lbs. They have exceptional vision,
          hearing and smell that helps them detect and avoid predators. Their
          large curved horns can weigh up to 30 lbs. Females also have horns but
          they are short with a slight curvature. Horns are used as tools for
          eating and fighting. If you encounter a big horn sheep, don’t agitate
          it. The park service asks that you stay 100 feet away from big game
          animals. Leave them enough room for escape if they feel threatened.
