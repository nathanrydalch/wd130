            I’ve never made these from scratch before. Typically, I make pan
            pizza on Friday night but this week I decided I wanted a change of
            pace. I already had most of the required ingredients anyways.

          <p class="recipe-pg">
            I added my yeast packet, sugar, olive oil, and salt to water as warm
            as our kitchen sink can go. While I was waiting for the yeast to
            ferment, I took out the trash. I end up doing it almost every day
            because one of my roommates, Alec, is a shoe guru and has an active
            collection. I always end up taking the shoe boxes out to the
            dumpster ‘cause they fill up the trash really fast.

            This is my patented dough making strategy. I like to use as few
            dishes as possible so I stir in the flour as much as I can with a
            butter knife in the measuring glass. It’s a good wrist workout too.

            Then I pour it out onto the flowered table and get kneading. We
            don’t have the cleanest apartment so just to be safe, I scrubbed the
            table 3 times (1 with all-purpose cleaner). There are quite a few
            sketchy looking stains all over the top. Might be the first time
            it’s been cleaned sense we moved in. After kneading the dough for 5
            minuets, I like to admire it for a bit.

            Next, I cut the mother ball into 8 dough boys and let rise. If your
            making pizza just cut it into two dough dads. I had the genius idea
            of making the dough at 1:00 PM, then putting in the fridge so they
            would be ready at 5:00 PM. Usually, the dough takes only an hour to
            rise but I go to Walmart at 2:00PM. At 5:00 PM they were risen
            perfectly.

            What’s a calzone without filling? I’d call it a sad dough bag. For
            sauce I just used Prego Pasta Sauce with Italian seasoning, salt,
            and garlic powder. Sometimes I go a little overboard with the garlic
            powder, but this time got it right. Might help if I used a measuring
            spoon or something…

            Time to load them up! I mostly did pepperoni with cheese and onions,
            but I did do 2 wild cards. One was pineapple with bacon bits. Other
            was spicy boy with jalapenos. I tried to really pack ‘em in because
            sometimes there hard to taste.

            With the calzones filled it was time to fold over and pinch the
            edges. As I made more of them, I think I improved. At the start I
            was trying to cram to much sauce and pepperonis in. Then the sauce
            would get in between the edges of the dough, and they wouldn’t stick
            so good.

            All that’s left is to bake them! I cut vent slits in the tops and
            lubed the top and bottom with olive oil. Mostly for looks, I
            sprinkled some parmesan cheese on them too. Chuck ‘em in the oven.

            Eat! These were defiantly a 10/10. Pan pizza is good but sometimes
            it’s nice to get some variety. I was the lucky guy who got the
            jalapeno one. I think I added the right amount although the peppers
            turned into a puree while baking. The one thing I would change next
            time I make these is add more cheese. When you have crust on the top
            and the bottom, at least double the cheese is needed. I cooked them
            in two batches. This is a pic of the second batch. The tops look
            really good, but the bottoms look like they were cooked on a
            campfire. Those are a little to browned even for me. When I saw the
            smoke coming out of the oven, I thought it was just the oil in the
            pan burning. Guess not. Luckily, we don’t have to worry about the
            smoke alarm bothering us ‘cause one of the guys unplugged it. I
            think it needed a new 9v and wouldn’t stop beeping.
