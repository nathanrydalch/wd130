          <p>
            I’ve always been a fan of egg and as far as I’m concerned, tortillas
            just make ‘em better. The part I have a hard time with is keeping
            each part hot. It seems like I end up with either a cold tortilla or
            cold eggs. When I was searching around for recipes, I found an
            innovative method that should solve all my troubles.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started by precooking my bacon first to get a little grease in the
            pan. Then I fried my tortilla in it. It took me 4 tries to get 2
            unburned ones. Burned ones were a good snack to hold me over while I
            cooked though. At Walmart you can buy these uncooked tortillas that
            are top notch. I would highly recommend.

            The eggs cooked easily. Getting the eggs to sit flat in the pan was
            kind of tricky because all the burners on our stove list to the left
            by 5 degrees. I just held it flat for a minuet while they set up. I
            cut up the bacon into bits with scissors directly on to the eggs. I
            put authentic Idaho cheese on top too.

            My brother Jacob doesn’t like crispy bacon, so I only warmed it up.
            I think he doesn’t trust me to brown them. After I “browned” some
            wontons a little on the crispy side we eat those soft too.

            This is the great idea. You put the cooked tortilla on top of the
            eggs and flip the whole burrito at once. It worked out quite well if
            I do say so myself. Two advantages; everything is warm when you eat
            it, and the eggs are already in the tortilla.

            Fold and eat! All and all I would rate this one 10/10. Easy to make
            (if you don’t mind eating a few burnt tortillas) and good flavor.
            Especially with some sour cream and siracha. If you’re in the market
            for some, the tabasco brand is top notch. I think they added more
            sugar to the recipe than the classic. Not the same flavor but
            defiantly worth trying.
